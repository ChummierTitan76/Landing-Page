# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

Landing Page Project: Learning To Code

This Project is designed to walk a user through the various benefits of learning to code with javascript. Users will be guided through the process, with each main section highlighting major points of interest. 


Dependencies:
Users will have to open the compressed ZIP file, and extract the project to their IDE of choice. This project was designed in VS Code, with the help of the 'Go Live" extension. Users will need to have a internet browser installed on their local machines to view the page. 


For Developers:

All files for the project can be found within the cd0428-landing-page folder. All styling has been done within the styles.css file. All scripts are located within the app.js file. 

Code has been separated by Section for ease of viewing. Global Variables have been declared near the top of the app.js document for maximum visibility/access.
